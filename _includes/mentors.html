I’ve had the opportunity to be a part on a few teams at Mason, such as the Tech for Good, Student Government, the autonomous robotics research lab, Advancement in Men’s Mental Health, and the CS Club as members/officers. I started Tech for Good from an idea in summer '23 to a club with 200+ members. During my freshman year, I studied abroad at Mason Korea. Something about me is that I love traveling, especially for attending hackathons. I also like reading about self-growth and business, running, sewing, and hiking. I have a white cockatoo named Tala. In terms of CS and technology, I have a few projects that I'm working on with awesome people. I’m very interested in its interdisciplinary applications to health, education, and other aspects of life. I cook - generally meals that I can prep very fast (10 min or less is the goal!) I love meeting new people and I really hope I can provide some value to anyone that’s interested in being my mentee!</p>
